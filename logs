***   8 Days Left for the Dead Line   *** 
*****************************************

Working on SP2015WA.  Read the point off from a problem I have not worked for a while.  That is good.

I have to work quickly in the morning.  I am going to repeat it in the afternoon if I can.  Start rushing at the biggining of the day.    

MC and WA has to be done before the deadline.  Three WA questions a day.  Do them as quickly as possible. 

Leave the desk more frequently (Work with older exams).  

Universal life.  Zeroization.  Modified Reserve.

Worked on SOA322.  There are not enough time left to solve all of the problems.  At least, the outcome would be better if I think that way. Started working from the last.   

I was good in reading WA exam problems when I was reading textbook. 

Not much can be done in a day.  Making a progress, regardless.

Working on two or three problems from WA exams is necessary.  This is to find out what I do have to read.  Then I could move on to the the SOA322, WA22.

Reading pension problems from the textbook.  For the participating insurance, I probably want to read AMLCR to clean up the details of this topic.  Read Markov Chain in AMLCR.


Expense Reserve
===============
Need to check more about Expense Reserve.  Expense Reserve (p.659).  Modified Reserve (p.777).
Adverse selection.


Markov Chain
============

Have to work on Markov Chains everyday.  Every WA has a Markov Chains problem.  There are many markov problems in SOA WA 22, also.  However, the problems in the textbook look different from the ones in the recent exams.  
    
Working on FA2015WA.  I have to read more of those topics introduced recently.    

What should I do next? I should work on the most important topics.  Pension, Markov Chain, Multiple Decrement, Profit Testing.  From the recent WA, MC.  I do have to use textbook, recent exams and SOA WA 22.  


Pension
=======

Basics are important.  I should repeat reading and solving the textbook prolems because of that.

SOA MC 322:  Working on it.  It takes me more time than I expected.  I should make a plan that does not require solving all of SOA322.  That is too time consuming.


Textbook
========

Spend an hour to read the textbook.  If pension chapter is too difficult, start from the profit testing chapter.

Keep on reading the textbook. Work on the examples, also.  That prepares me for the WA questions.  I have to build a firm understanding in order to see the issue the questions are trying to address.     

Textbook is WA question banks.  For now, read the pension chapter.  I have solved a cuple of pension questions.  Does it make reading easier?
