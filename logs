*** I have only two month left. ***   
***********************************

What is the easiest thing to do in this subject?  The question I get it right over and over again.

Universal life.  Zeroization.

I am discovering topics I need to know better.  Need to write them down.   

There are many important topics in the WA that I have not noticed.  

I have to make use of the time in the morning.  This is I really have to do.  I am starting in the afternoon.    

Worked on SOA322.  There are not enough time left to solve all of the problems.  At least, the outcome would be better if I think that way. Started working on from the latest.   

I was good in reading exam problems when I was reading textbook.  I have to see wheather it really is the case.  
Is it possible to allocate time to read AMLCR at this point?

Not much can be done in a day. Making a progress, regardless.

Working on two or three problems from WA exams is necessary.  Start them as soon as possible.  This is to find out what I do have to read.  Then I could move on to the the SOA322, WA22.

Spending less time on reading these days.  That is, it is going to be the same as the last time. I might need to spend an hour every day for reading the textbook. 

Reading pension problem from the textbook.  But probably, moving to SP2016MC.

Started the participating insurance.  I probably want to read AMLCR to clean up the details of this topic.       

For a while since started Markov Chain. Needs to read AMLCR.     

Working on FA2015MC.

Worked on profit testing.  Good.    


Expense Reserve
===============



Profit Testing
==============




Markov Chain
============

I am working on Markov Chains everyday which is good.  Every WA has a Markov Chains problem.  There are many markov problems in SOA WA 22, also.  However, the problems in the textbook look different from the ones in the recent exams.  
    
Working on FA2015WA.  I have to read more of those topics introduced recently.  I have to work quicker and come up with times to read AMLCR.  

It was good that I started working on SOA322.  I am going to work on SOA WA 22 tomorrow. 

What should I do next? I should work on the most important topics.  Pension, Markov Chain, Multiple Decrement, Profit Testing.  From the recent WA, MC.  I do have to use textbook, recent exams and SOA WA 22.  I have to come up with an idea that I can focus more on the work.


Pension
=======

Basics are important.  I should repeat reading and solving the textbook prolems because of that.

SOA MC 322:  Working on it.  It takes me more time than I expected.  I should make a plan that does not require solving all of SOA322.  That is too time consuming.

How about waking up early in the morning?


Textbook
========

Spend an hour to read the textbook.  If pension chapter is too difficult, start from the profit testing chapter.

Keep on reading the textbook. Work on the examples, also.  That prepares me for the WA questions.  I have to build a firm understanding in order to see the issue the questions are trying to address.     

Textbook is WA question banks.  For now, read the pension chapter.  I have solved a cuple of pension questions.  Does it make reading easier?
