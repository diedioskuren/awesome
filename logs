Reading pension problems from the textbook.  For the participating insurance, I probably want to read AMLCR to clean up the details of this topic.  Read Markov Chain in AMLCR.


Expense Reserve
===============
Need to check more about Expense Reserve.  Expense Reserve (p.659).  Modified Reserve (p.777).
Adverse selection.  Zeroization.


Markov Chain
============

Have to work on Markov Chains everyday.  Every WA has a Markov Chains problem.  There are many markov problems in SOA WA 22, also.  However, the problems in the textbook look different from the ones in the recent exams.  
    
Working on FA2015WA.  I have to read more of those topics introduced recently.    

What should I do next? I should work on the most important topics.  Pension, Markov Chain, Multiple Decrement, Profit Testing.  From the recent WA, MC.  I do have to use textbook, recent exams and SOA WA 22.  


Textbook
========

Spend an hour to read the textbook.  If pension chapter is too difficult, start from the profit testing chapter.

Keep on reading the textbook. Work on the examples, also.  That prepares me for the WA questions.  I have to build a firm understanding in order to see the issue the questions are trying to address.     

Textbook is WA question banks.  For now, read the pension chapter.  I have solved a cuple of pension questions.  Does it make reading easier?
